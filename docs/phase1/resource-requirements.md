## Conclusion

### Resource Requirements Summary

**Immediate Phase 1 Requirements:**

- Hardware: Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB) with 256GB NVMe SSD
- Memory: 6-8GB for development environment
- Storage: 100-500GB for complete development setup
- Network: Gigabit connectivity for real-time services
- Team: 10 parallel development agents

**Production Scaling Requirements:**

- Hardware: 11-node Raspberry Pi 5 cluster
- Memory: 88GB total cluster capacity
- Storage: 12.25TB raw storage (3.3TB usable with redundancy)
- Network: Dedicated cluster networking with 1-10 Gbps backbone
- Operational: Comprehensive monitoring and management systems

**Critical Success Factors:**

1. **Memory Management**: Address current 60% swap usage immediately
2. **Storage Performance**: NVMe SSDs essential for production workloads
3. **Network Architecture**: Proper network segmentation for security and performance
4. **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Real-time resource monitoring and alerting
5. **Scaling Automation**: Auto-scaling capabilities for efficient resource utilization

**Investment Priorities:**

1. **Phase 1**: $500-1,000 (development hardware upgrade)
2. **Production Cluster**: $5,000-10,000 (11-node cluster)
3. **Operational Tools**: $1,000-3,000 (monitoring, backup systems)
4. **Annual Operations**: $1,000-3,000 (maintenance, power, upgrades)

The resource requirements analysis indicates that the ArgosFinal migration is feasible within the established hardware constraints, with clear scaling paths for production deployment. The current Raspberry Pi ecosystem provides an excellent foundation for both development and production deployment, with cost-effective scaling options as requirements grow.
