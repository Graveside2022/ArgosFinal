# ROLLBACK INCIDENT LOG

## Feature Creep Prevention Framework

### PURPOSE

This log documents all incidents where the Feature Creep Prevention Framework detected violations and triggered rollback procedures. Each incident provides learning opportunities to strengthen the framework.

## INCIDENT TEMPLATE

```markdown
## INCIDENT #[NUMBER] - [DATE]

### Overview

- **Date/Time**: [ISO 8601 timestamp]
- **Trigger**: [What caused the rollback]
- **Severity**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]

## INCIDENT REPORTING PROCESS

### Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes)

1. **STOP** - Halt all related development work
2. **ASSESS** - Determine severity level
3. **ROLLBACK** - Execute appropriate rollback procedure
4. **COMMUNICATE** - Notify team of incident

### Short-term Actions (15 minutes - 2 hours)

1. **VERIFY** - Confirm rollback success
2. **DOCUMENT** - Record incident details
3. **ANALYZE** - Begin root cause analysis
4. **SECURE** - Prevent similar violations

### Long-term Actions (2 hours - 1 week)

1. **IMPROVE** - Enhance framework based on learnings
2. **TRAIN** - Update team training materials
3. **VALIDATE** - Test framework improvements
4. **COMMUNICATE** - Share lessons learned
