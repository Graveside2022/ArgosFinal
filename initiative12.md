## TypeScript Error Prioritization Framework

This framework categorizes TypeScript errors into four priority levels (P0-P3) to ensure that the most critical issues are addressed first.

#### **P0: Critical - "Showstoppers"**
*   **Description:** Errors that prevent compilation, cause runtime crashes, or lead to definite data corruption.
*   **Criteria:** Compilation failures, runtime type crashes (e.g., null errors), critical type mismatches, incorrect module resolution.

#### **P1: High - "High-Impact Tech Debt"**
*   **Description:** Errors that introduce significant risk of subtle bugs and seriously degrade code quality.
*   **Criteria:** Implicit/explicit `any`, type assertion abuse, non-null assertion misuse, incorrect property access, argument/parameter type mismatches.

#### **P2: Medium - "Code Health & Maintainability"**
*   **Description:** Errors that make code harder to read, maintain, and refactor.
*   **Criteria:** Missing return types, complex/inconsistent types, circular type references, type-only import errors.

#### **P3: Low - "Housekeeping & Best Practices"**
*   **Description:** Minor issues that violate best practices but pose no direct risk.
*   **Criteria:** Unused variables/imports, redundant type annotations.

## Prioritized Error Remediation Plan (76-101)

### P0: Critical Issues (Runtime Crash / Build Failure)

**1. Error #76: Cannot find module '$lib/types/signals'**
*   **File:** `tests/unit/services/map/signalClustering.test.ts(3,50)`
*   **Priority:** P0 (Critical)
*   **Justification:** This is a build-breaking configuration error. The test suite cannot run or resolve module paths correctly without this fix. It prevents any tests in the affected file from executing.
*   **A+ Solution:** Configure Vitest to resolve SvelteKit path aliases by updating `vitest.config.ts` with a `resolve.alias` entry for `$lib`.

**2. Error #78: Could not find a declaration file for module 'pngjs'.**
*   **File:** `tests/visual/visual-regression.test.ts(4,21)`
*   **Priority:** P0 (Critical)
*   **Justification:** The TypeScript compiler cannot verify the types for the `pngjs` module, effectively making it `any`. This breaks the build process for these files under stricter settings and completely undermines type safety for any interactions with the module.
*   **A+ Solution:** Install the community-provided type definitions: `npm install --save-dev @types/pngjs`.

**3. Errors #80-98: Duplicates of 'WebSocket' type mismatch and 'is possibly null' errors.**
*   **File:** `tests/integration/websocket.test.ts`
*   **Priority:** P0 (Critical)
*   **Justification:** These 19 errors are all duplicates of the two most critical issues in the test suite: the `WebSocket` type mismatch (leading to runtime crashes on method calls) and failure to check for `null` (leading to runtime crashes on access). They must be fixed to ensure test stability.
*   **A+ Solution:**
    1.  Import `WebSocket` from the `ws` library in `tests/integration/websocket.test.ts`.
    2.  Use optional chaining (`ws?.`) or null checks (`if (ws)`) before accessing the `ws` variable in test teardown hooks.

### P1: High-Impact Issues

**4. Error #77: Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'altitude' does not exist...**
*   **File:** `tests/utils/testDataGenerator.ts(148,11)`
*   **Priority:** P1 (High)
*   **Justification:** This is a typo (`altitude` vs. `latitude`) that leads to incorrect data generation. Test data that doesn't match the actual data model is misleading and can cause tests to pass when they should fail (or vice-versa).
*   **A+ Solution:** Correct the typo from `altitude` to `latitude`.

**5. Error #79: No overload matches this call.**
*   **File:** `tests/visual/visual-regression.test.ts(73,29)`
*   **Priority:** P1 (High)
*   **Justification:** Calling a function with an invalid set of arguments will cause a runtime error. In this case, Playwright's `screenshot` method will fail because the path is malformed.
*   **A+ Solution:** Ensure the `path` provided to the `screenshot` function is a valid file path ending with a supported image extension (e.g., `.png`).

**6. Errors #99, #100: Property 'type' does not exist...**
*   **Files:** `src/lib/services/db/dataAccessLayer.ts(325,81)`, `src/lib/services/db/signalDatabase.ts(488,56)`
*   **Priority:** P1 (High)
*   **Justification:** These are duplicates of previously identified high-impact errors. Accessing a non-existent property will result in `undefined` at runtime, likely causing incorrect database queries or data handling.
*   **A+ Solution:** Correct the property access to use a valid property from the object's type definition.

### P3: Low-Impact Issues

**7. Error #101: Unused '@ts-expect-error' directive.**
*   **File:** `src/lib/services/kismet/kismetService.ts(230,4)`
*   **Priority:** P3 (Low)
*   **Justification:** This indicates that a `@ts-expect-error` comment, which was likely added to suppress a temporary error, is no longer needed because the underlying error has been fixed. It's a minor housekeeping issue that should be cleaned up to avoid confusion.
*   **A+ Solution:** Remove the unnecessary `// @ts-expect-error` comment.
