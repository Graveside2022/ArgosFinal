# Grid-Based Signal Aggregation Implementation

## Overview

Implemented an enhanced grid-based signal aggregation system to reduce visual clutter and improve performance when displaying large numbers of signals on the tactical map.

## Key Features

### 1. Enhanced Grid Processing Algorithm

- **Adaptive Grid Sizing**: Grid size automatically adjusts based on zoom level (25m-200m)
- **Signal Aggregation**: Multiple signals within a grid cell are combined using:
    - Peak power with 95th percentile weighting
    - Density-based confidence factors
    - Temporal span considerations

### 2. Improved Frequency Band Categorization

- Added granular frequency band detection:
    - FM Radio, Aircraft VHF, Amateur bands
    - Multiple cellular bands (LTE-850, LTE-1700, LTE-1900, etc.)
    - WiFi sub-bands (2.4GHz, 5GHz Low/High)
    - ISM and industrial bands
- Grouped into categories: WiFi, Cellular, Amateur Radio, Public Service, ISM/Industrial

### 3. Grid Cell Visualization

- **Visual Indicators**:
    - Cell color based on aggregated signal strength
    - Border thickness indicates signal density (thicker = more signals)
    - Dashed borders for very dense cells (>80% density factor)
    - Count labels with category icons for cells with 3+ signals

- **Category Icons**:
    - üì∂ WiFi
    - üì± Cellular
    - üìª Amateur Radio
    - üöÅ Public Service
    - üì° Other/Industrial

### 4. Enhanced Statistics Display

- Per-cell information:
    - Signal count and aggregated power
    - Top 5 frequencies by power
    - Frequency band distribution
    - Temporal span and confidence factor
    - Signal density per 100m¬≤

- Grid overview panel:
    - Total active cells and signals
    - Average density across grid
    - Signal category breakdown
    - Dynamic grid size indicator

### 5. Heatmap Integration

- Grid cells can be used as input for heatmap visualization
- `processGridCells()` method in HeatmapService converts grid data to weighted points
- Higher density cells generate multiple heatmap points for better representation
- Confidence-weighted intensity values

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Files:

1. `/static/workers/gridProcessor.js`
    - Enhanced aggregation algorithm
    - Improved frequency band detection
    - Added category grouping
    - Better statistical calculations

2. `/src/lib/services/map/gridProcessor.ts`
    - Updated TypeScript interfaces
    - Added FrequencyInfo type
    - Enhanced GridCell structure

3. `/src/lib/services/map/heatmapService.ts`
    - Added `processGridCells()` method
    - Grid-optimized heatmap rendering

4. `/src/routes/tactical-map/+page.svelte`
    - Enhanced grid visualization
    - Improved popup information
    - Better UI controls
    - Grid/heatmap integration

## Usage

### Enable Grid Aggregation:

1. Click "Grid Aggregation" button in the control panel
2. Grid cells will automatically update as signals are received
3. Adjust grid size using the dropdown (25m/50m/100m/200m)

### Combined with Heatmap:

1. Enable both "Heatmap" and "Grid Aggregation"
2. Heatmap will use aggregated grid data for better performance
3. Reduces visual noise while maintaining signal density information

### Performance Benefits:

- Reduces number of rendered elements from thousands to hundreds
- Aggregates signals intelligently based on location and time
- Maintains signal detail through statistical aggregation
- Improves map navigation responsiveness

## Configuration Options

### Grid Size:

- **25m**: High detail for focused analysis
- **50m**: Balanced view (default)
- **100m**: Wide area coverage
- **200m**: Regional overview

### Auto-adjustment:

- Zoom 16+: 25m grid
- Zoom 14-15: 50m grid
- Zoom 12-13: 100m grid
- Zoom <12: 200m grid

## Future Enhancements

- Hexagonal grid option for better coverage
- Time-based aggregation windows
- Export grid statistics
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection per grid cell
