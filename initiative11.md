## TypeScript Error Prioritization Framework

This framework categorizes TypeScript errors into four priority levels (P0-P3) to ensure that the most critical issues are addressed first.

#### **P0: Critical - "Showstoppers"**
*   **Description:** Errors that prevent compilation, cause runtime crashes, or lead to definite data corruption.
*   **Criteria:** Compilation failures, runtime type crashes (e.g., null errors), critical type mismatches, incorrect module resolution.

#### **P1: High - "High-Impact Tech Debt"**
*   **Description:** Errors that introduce significant risk of subtle bugs and seriously degrade code quality.
*   **Criteria:** Implicit/explicit `any`, type assertion abuse, non-null assertion misuse, incorrect property access, argument/parameter type mismatches.

#### **P2: Medium - "Code Health & Maintainability"**
*   **Description:** Errors that make code harder to read, maintain, and refactor.
*   **Criteria:** Missing return types, complex/inconsistent types, circular type references, type-only import errors.

#### **P3: Low - "Housekeeping & Best Practices"**
*   **Description:** Minor issues that violate best practices but pose no direct risk.
*   **Criteria:** Unused variables/imports, redundant type annotations.

## Prioritized Error Remediation Plan (51-75)

### P0: Critical Issues (Runtime Crash / Build Failure)

**1. Errors #43, #45, #47, #49, #51, #53, #56, #58: Type 'WebSocket' is missing properties...**
*   **File:** `tests/integration/websocket.test.ts`
*   **Priority:** P0 (Critical)
*   **Justification:** This recurring error indicates a fundamental type mismatch between the browser `WebSocket` and the Node.js `ws` library's `WebSocket`. Calling methods that exist on one but not the other will lead to immediate runtime crashes. This is the most critical type of error in this file.
*   **A+ Solution:** Ensure the correct `WebSocket` type is imported from the `ws` library at the top of the test file. This single fix will resolve all these errors.

**2. Errors #44, #46, #48, #50, #52, #54, #55, #57, #59, #60, #61: 'ws' is possibly 'null'.**
*   **File:** `tests/integration/websocket.test.ts`
*   **Priority:** P0 (Critical)
*   **Justification:** Accessing a potentially `null` variable without a check will cause a `TypeError` at runtime, crashing the test runner's teardown process. This is a direct violation of `strictNullChecks` and must be fixed to ensure test stability.
*   **A+ Solution:** Add a null check (`if (ws)`) or use optional chaining (`ws?.close()`) before attempting to access the `ws` variable in `afterEach`/`afterAll` blocks.

**3. Errors #68, #69: Conversion of type 'WebSocket' to type 'import("...").default' may be a mistake...**
*   **File:** `tests/performance/benchmarks.test.ts`
*   **Priority:** P0 (Critical)
*   **Justification:** This is another symptom of the `WebSocket` type mismatch. While phrased as a "conversion," it highlights an incorrect type assertion that will fail at runtime when methods from the `ws` library are called.
*   **A+ Solution:** Explicitly import and use the `WebSocket` type from the `ws` package throughout the test file.

### P1: High-Impact Issues

**4. Errors #63, #64, #65: Property '...' does not exist on type 'PerformanceReport'.**
*   **File:** `tests/load/dataVolumes.test.ts`
*   **Priority:** P1 (High)
*   **Justification:** The test is attempting to access properties that are not defined on the `PerformanceReport` type. This will result in `undefined` values, leading to failed assertions and potentially masking real performance issues.
*   **A+ Solution:** Update the `PerformanceReport` interface to include all the expected properties (`avgResponseTime`, `peakMemoryUsage`, `errorRate`).

**5. Error #62: Conversion of type 'Signal' to type 'SignalMarker' may be a mistake...**
*   **File:** `tests/load/dataVolumes.test.ts`
*   **Priority:** P1 (High)
*   **Justification:** This error indicates a forced type assertion between two incompatible types. This bypasses type safety and can hide bugs if the structures of `Signal` and `SignalMarker` diverge.
*   **A+ Solution:** Create a dedicated mapping function (`toSignalMarker`) to explicitly and safely transform a `Signal` object into a `SignalMarker`.

**6. Errors #66, #67: Conversion of type 'PerformanceReport' to type '{...}' may be a mistake...**
*   **File:** `tests/load/dataVolumes.test.ts`
*   **Priority:** P1 (High)
*   **Justification:** The test is incorrectly asserting that a data object has methods. This indicates a misunderstanding of the data structure and leads to brittle tests.
*   **A+ Solution:** Refactor the test to calculate the required metrics from the `PerformanceReport` data object, rather than attempting to call non-existent methods on it.

**7. Errors #70, #71, #72, #73: Argument of type '{...}' is not assignable to parameter of type 'SignalCluster'.**
*   **File:** `tests/services/map/signalClustering.test.ts`
*   **Priority:** P1 (High)
*   **Justification:** The test is creating mock data that is inconsistent with the `SignalCluster` type. This will cause the function under test to fail or behave unexpectedly.
*   **A+ Solution:** Ensure the mock test data objects include all properties required by the `SignalCluster` interface (e.g., `lat`, `lon`).

**8. Error #74: Type '...' is not assignable to type '{...}'**
*   **File:** `tests/setup.ts`
*   **Priority:** P1 (High)
*   **Justification:** The mock for `getContext` is inaccurate. This can lead to tests passing in a synthetic environment but failing to reflect the real behavior of the canvas API, potentially hiding rendering bugs.
*   **A+ Solution:** Improve the mock to more accurately represent the overloaded `getContext` function.

### P2: Medium-Impact Issues

**9. Error #75: 'devices' is referenced directly or indirectly in its own type annotation.**
*   **File:** `tests/unit/components.test.ts`
*   **Priority:** P2 (Medium)
*   **Justification:** This circular reference makes the type definition confusing and can cause issues with tooling and type inference. It's a code structure problem that impacts maintainability.
*   **A+ Solution:** Break the circular reference by defining the component's props type (`DeviceListProps`) separately before using it.
