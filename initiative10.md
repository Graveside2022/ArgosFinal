## TypeScript Error Prioritization Framework

This framework categorizes TypeScript errors into four priority levels (P0-P3) to ensure that the most critical issues are addressed first.

#### **P0: Critical - "Showstoppers"**
*   **Description:** Errors that prevent compilation, cause runtime crashes, or lead to definite data corruption.
*   **Criteria:** Compilation failures, runtime type crashes (e.g., null errors), critical type mismatches, incorrect module resolution.

#### **P1: High - "High-Impact Tech Debt"**
*   **Description:** Errors that introduce significant risk of subtle bugs and seriously degrade code quality.
*   **Criteria:** Implicit/explicit `any`, type assertion abuse, non-null assertion misuse, incorrect property access, argument/parameter type mismatches.

#### **P2: Medium - "Code Health & Maintainability"**
*   **Description:** Errors that make code harder to read, maintain, and refactor.
*   **Criteria:** Missing return types, complex/inconsistent types, circular type references, type-only import errors.

#### **P3: Low - "Housekeeping & Best Practices"**
*   **Description:** Minor issues that violate best practices but pose no direct risk.
*   **Criteria:** Unused variables/imports, redundant type annotations.

## Prioritized Error Remediation Plan (26-50)

### P0: Critical Issues (Runtime Crash / Build Failure)

**1. Error #39: Cannot find module '$lib/types/signals'**
*   **File:** `tests/unit/services/map/signalClustering.test.ts(3,50)`
*   **Priority:** P0 (Critical)
*   **Justification:** This is a build-breaking configuration error. The test suite cannot run or resolve module paths correctly without this fix. It prevents any tests in the affected file from executing.
*   **A+ Solution:** Configure Vitest to resolve SvelteKit path aliases by updating `vitest.config.ts` with a `resolve.alias` entry for `$lib`.

**2. Error #31: 'ws' is possibly 'null'.**
*   **File:** `tests/integration/websocket.test.ts(19,14)`
*   **Priority:** P0 (Critical)
*   **Justification:** Accessing a potentially `null` variable without a check will cause a `TypeError` at runtime, crashing the test runner's teardown process. This is a direct violation of `strictNullChecks`.
*   **A+ Solution:** Add a null check (`if (ws)`) or use optional chaining (`ws?.close()`) before attempting to close the WebSocket connection in `afterEach`/`afterAll` blocks.

**3. Error #30: Type 'WebSocket' is missing properties...**
*   **File:** `tests/integration/websocket.test.ts(18,7)`
*   **Priority:** P0 (Critical)
*   **Justification:** This indicates a fundamental type mismatch between the browser `WebSocket` and the Node.js `ws` library's `WebSocket`. Calling methods that exist on one but not the other will lead to immediate runtime crashes.
*   **A+ Solution:** Ensure the correct `WebSocket` type is imported from the `ws` library for the Node.js test environment.

**4. Error #35: Conversion of type 'WebSocket' to type 'import("...").default' may be a mistake...**
*   **Files:** `tests/performance/benchmarks.test.ts(105,15)` & `(167,15)`
*   **Priority:** P0 (Critical)
*   **Justification:** This is another symptom of the `WebSocket` type mismatch. While phrased as a "conversion," it highlights an incorrect type assertion that will fail at runtime when methods from the `ws` library are called.
*   **A+ Solution:** Explicitly import and use the `WebSocket` type from the `ws` package throughout the test file.

**5. Error #26 & #41: Could not find a declaration file for module 'pngjs'.**
*   **Files:** `tests/helpers/visual-helpers.ts(3,21)` & `tests/visual/visual-regression.test.ts(4,21)`
*   **Priority:** P0 (Critical)
*   **Justification:** The TypeScript compiler cannot verify the types for the `pngjs` module, effectively making it `any`. This breaks the build process for these files under stricter settings and completely undermines type safety for any interactions with the module.
*   **A+ Solution:** Install the community-provided type definitions: `npm install --save-dev @types/pngjs`.

### P1: High-Impact Issues

**6. Error #33: Property '...' does not exist on type 'PerformanceReport'.**
*   **File:** `tests/load/dataVolumes.test.ts(203,19)`
*   **Priority:** P1 (High)
*   **Justification:** The test is attempting to access properties that are not defined on the `PerformanceReport` type. This will result in `undefined` values, leading to failed assertions and potentially masking real performance issues.
*   **A+ Solution:** Update the `PerformanceReport` interface to include all the expected properties (`avgResponseTime`, `peakMemoryUsage`, `errorRate`).

**7. Error #40: Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'altitude' does not exist...**
*   **File:** `tests/utils/testDataGenerator.ts(148,11)`
*   **Priority:** P1 (High)
*   **Justification:** This is a typo (`altitude` vs. `latitude`) that leads to incorrect data generation. Test data that doesn't match the actual data model is misleading and can cause tests to pass when they should fail (or vice-versa).
*   **A+ Solution:** Correct the typo from `altitude` to `latitude`.

**8. Error #36: Argument of type '{...}' is not assignable to parameter of type 'SignalCluster'.**
*   **File:** `tests/services/map/signalClustering.test.ts(117,46)`
*   **Priority:** P1 (High)
*   **Justification:** The test is creating mock data that is inconsistent with the `SignalCluster` type, specifically missing `lat` and `lon`. This will cause the function under test to fail or behave unexpectedly.
*   **A+ Solution:** Ensure the mock test data object includes all properties required by the `SignalCluster` interface.

**9. Error #28: Argument of type '...' is not assignable to parameter of type '...'.**
*   **File:** `tests/integration/api.test.ts(143,20)`
*   **Priority:** P1 (High)
*   **Justification:** The code is making an unsafe assumption about the type of data in an array of `unknown`. Without a type guard, accessing properties on `device` could lead to a runtime error if an element is not an object.
*   **A+ Solution:** Use a type guard (`typeof device === 'object'`) inside the `forEach` loop before accessing properties to ensure type safety.

**10. Error #32: Conversion of type 'Signal' to type 'SignalMarker' may be a mistake...**
*   **File:** `tests/load/dataVolumes.test.ts(82,32)`
*   **Priority:** P1 (High)
*   **Justification:** This error indicates a forced type assertion between two incompatible types. This bypasses type safety and can hide bugs if the structures of `Signal` and `SignalMarker` diverge.
*   **A+ Solution:** Create a dedicated mapping function (`toSignalMarker`) to explicitly and safely transform a `Signal` object into a `SignalMarker`.

**11. Error #42: No overload matches this call.**
*   **File:** `tests/visual/visual-regression.test.ts(73,29)`
*   **Priority:** P1 (High)
*   **Justification:** Calling a function with an invalid set of arguments will cause a runtime error. In this case, Playwright's `screenshot` method will fail because the path is malformed.
*   **A+ Solution:** Ensure the `path` provided to the `screenshot` function is a valid file path ending with a supported image extension (e.g., `.png`).

**12. Error #37: Type '...' is not assignable to type '{...}'**
*   **File:** `tests/setup.ts(30,1)`
*   **Priority:** P1 (High)
*   **Justification:** The mock for `getContext` is inaccurate. This can lead to tests passing in a synthetic environment but failing to reflect the real behavior of the canvas API, potentially hiding rendering bugs.
*   **A+ Solution:** Improve the mock to more accurately represent the overloaded `getContext` function, returning a mock 2D context object with mocked methods.

**13. Error #27: Expected 1-2 arguments, but got 3.**
*   **File:** `tests/helpers/visual-helpers.ts(246,7)`
*   **Priority:** P1 (High)
*   **Justification:** Calling a function with the wrong number of arguments will cause a runtime error.
*   **A+ Solution:** Correct the function call to match its signature.

### P2: Medium-Impact Issues

**14. Error #29: 'Browser' is a type and must be imported using a type-only import...**
*   **File:** `tests/integration/app.test.ts(2,20)`
*   **Priority:** P2 (Medium)
*   **Justification:** This is a code style and consistency issue enforced by the `verbatimModuleSyntax` compiler option. While it doesn't cause runtime errors, fixing it improves code clarity and adheres to modern TypeScript best practices.
*   **A+ Solution:** Use the `import type` syntax for all type-only imports.

**15. Error #38: 'devices' is referenced directly or indirectly in its own type annotation.**
*   **File:** `tests/unit/components.test.ts(199,32)`
*   **Priority:** P2 (Medium)
*   **Justification:** This circular reference makes the type definition confusing and can cause issues with tooling and type inference. It's a code structure problem that impacts maintainability.
*   **A+ Solution:** Break the circular reference by defining the component's props type (`DeviceListProps`) separately before using it.
